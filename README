This software is clone from https://gitorious.org/recedro/jepoc
But gitorious has closed down and therefore the link "https://gitorious.org/recedro/jepoc" is no longer working.

I tested it on Allwinner A20.

jepoc - jpeg encoder poc

Compile dependencies:
	libjpeg8	used to create jpeg header tables.

Usage example:
	./jepoc 256 256 100 out.jpeg
